# Sample-Codes-
Hello and welcome to my Github repository! In this repository, I have shared some sample Stata codes that demonstrate my ability to input data, clean the data, do exploratory data analysis, run experimental and non-experimental impact evaluations using regressions and graphs for summary statistics and to study trends.

Please note that the sample codes shared here are not for sharing and are shared in a way that they cannot be traced back to the source for confidentiality purposes. I have made sure that any identifiable information has been removed or modified to protect the privacy of the individuals and organizations involved.

In order to run these codes, you will need to have Stata software installed on your computer. Once you have installed Stata, you can open the .do files and run them on your own data.

The sample codes shared in this repository are organized into parts within the code based on the type of analysis or task. For example, under the "Data Input and Cleaning" header , you will find sample codes that demonstrate how to input and clean data. In the "Exploratory Data Analysis" header, you will find sample codes that demonstrate how to explore the data using various summary statistics and graphs. Under the Regression analysis" header, you will find sample codes that demonstrate how to run impact evaluations using regression analysis and graphs.

I have tried to document the codes as much as possible, so you should be able to follow along with the code and understand what each line does. However, if you have any questions or need further clarification, please feel free to contact me on sanyasrivastava@uchicago.edu

Thank you for taking the time to visit my Github repository. I hope you find the sample codes useful and informative!
